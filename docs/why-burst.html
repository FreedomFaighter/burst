It excels at measuring, organizing, and pattern matching trends and causes for behaviors --- even in very large historical records. Burst finds these behaviors even though they can span time and be buried in the noise of insignificant actions. While traditional database solutions have been used to analyze behaviors, their original&nbsp;focus on relationships instead of causality means they fail in&nbsp;performance when used at scale. Burst solves the behavior analysis&nbsp;problem through innovative architecture and design.</span></p>

                        <p class="p-why-burst"><span style="color: rgb(36, 41, 47);">With any data analysis system in the vast mix of industry proprietary and open-source alternatives, there are basically three questions one needs to ask.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(36, 41, 47); background-color: rgb(237, 231, 231);">What</span><span style="color: rgb(36, 41, 47);">&nbsp;is it,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(36, 41, 47); background-color: rgb(237, 231, 231);">why</span><span style="color: rgb(36, 41, 47);">&nbsp;is it valuable, and&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(36, 41, 47); background-color: rgb(237, 231, 231);">how</span><span style="color: rgb(36, 41, 47);">&nbsp;does it work? Here we will address those questions as well as endeavour to clarify where Burst adds unique and differentiated value and how that value is provided.</span></p>
                        <h3><strong><span style="color: rgb(36, 41, 47);">What is Burst?</span></strong></h3>
                        <p class="p-why-burst"><span style="color: rgb(36, 41, 47);">First off, Burst fits solidly into a specialized category called&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(36, 41, 47); background-color: rgb(237, 231, 231);">behavioral analysis</span><span style="color: rgb(36, 41, 47);">.</span><br><span style="color: rgb(36, 41, 47);">We use the term behavioral very carefully in order to distinguish Burst from the much more common relational analysis category. Burst allows you to ask behavioral questions about behavioral data, whereas relational analysis systems allow you to ask relational questions about relational data.</span>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h4 class="why-burst-h4-title"><strong><span style="color: rgb(36, 41, 47);">Relational analysis</span></strong></h4>
                        <p class="p-why-burst"><span style="color: rgb(36, 41, 47); background-color: rgb(237, 231, 231);">Relational analysis</span><span style="color: rgb(36, 41, 47);">&nbsp;systems understand data as one or more tables each with zero or more rows of one or more columns of values. The ubiquitous SQL language API allows you to ask questions that relate the rows in one table to the rows in the same or a different table(s) using operators such as filter, aggregate, project, group, and join. Often the tables are designed to efficiently contain a very large number of rows and thus support fast complex questions. Mostly these systems are transactional &amp; persistent data storage systems i.e. these questions can write as well as read the data and that data is permanently available, resilient to failure, and provide simple consistent semantics in the face of concurrent access. Because questions are asked directly to this reliable store, the answers are 100% ‘current’ or ‘up to date’. Examples of relational systems are MySql, Postgres, Oracle, Postgres, and many many others.</span></p>
                        <h1 class="why-burst-h4-title"><strong><span style="color: rgb(36, 41, 47);">Behavioral Analysis</span></strong><br></h1>
                        <p class="p-why-burst"><span style="color: rgb(36, 41, 47); background-color: rgb(237, 231, 231);">Behavioral analysis</span><span style="color: rgb(36, 41, 47);">&nbsp;systems however, understand data as a set of entities that emit complex causal or time-ordered events that represent their historical behavior. Generally an altered SQL language API is provided that allows you to ask questions about all or a subset of these entities and their historical events using operations such as filter, aggregate, group, and sequence-match (temporalize). The resulting answer is a table or set of rows that capture an interesting and valuable pattern or signal in a large, complex, often noisy dataset. The goal is to have this answer clearly illuminate essential and otherwise obscured normative/outlier characteristics exhibited by some interesting cohort within the greater community of entities. These systems are generally operating on ephemeral ETL snapshots imported as a time window from a stream or from a remote database or storage system. There are not very many behavioral analysis systems available out there because most aren’t generalized frameworks and many are simply bespoke code implemented on top of key-value stores or databases. Examples of generalized behavioral systems are Burst and Druid.</span><br></p>

                        <h3 style="padding-top: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(36, 41, 47);">Why is Burst?</span></strong><br></h3>
                        <hr style="height: 3px;">
                        <p class="p-why-burst"><span style="color: rgb(36, 41, 47);">It is possible to store behavioral data in a relational system and ask behavioral questions using carefully crafted relational queries. It is also possible to put your data in a key-value store e.g. Hadoop or HBase, and use carefully crafted map-reduce based processing models e.g. Hadoop or Spark. But for good reason these awkward cross fit architectures are problematic in terms of performance, ease of use, flexibility, and/or implementation complexity when trying to deliver a general purpose ad-hoc behavioral solution. Real world experience shows that large behavioral datasets, tight latency constraints, and full featured behavioral questions dictate highly optimized and quite specialized architectural approaches.</span><br></p>
                        <p class="p-why-burst"><span style="color: rgb(36, 41, 47);">Behavioral calculus requires stunning amounts of highly repetitive low level data accesses and calculations such as counting and grouping. The math involved is for the most part trivial but the data structures and algorithms must be flawless in how they scale in terms of both CPU and memory demands. Great attention must be paid to how the data is binary encoded, distributed across nodes and loaded into modern multicore memory architectures. The high-level language driven analytic queries must be processed into perfectly distilled inner loop algorithms that are sequences of low-level hardware-sympathetic native instruction sequences that drive all the cores on a given node to near 100% utilization. The query requests must be scattered across hundreds or even thousands of processing nodes, all data processed and the results gathered fast enough to sustain the end user in a friction free ‘virtuous’ interactive question/answer/better-question cycle. These challenges are a make or break proposition for even the simplest queries given the enormous data sizes involved. Where in some domains a query simply is less fast that desired, in this domain a poorly executed query can literally become unstable and never return.</span><br></p>
                        <h3 style="padding-top: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(36, 41, 47);">How is Burst</span></strong><br></h3>
                        <hr style="height: 3px;">
                        <p class="p-why-burst"><span style="color: rgb(36, 41, 47);">The way that Burst addresses this performance challenge is by first providing a highly scalable distributed worker data processing topology. Burst scales across an almost unlimited quantity of worker nodes each with the vast number of cores that characterizes modern server hardware, almost without limit.</span><br></p>
                        <p class="p-why-burst"><span style="color: rgb(36, 41, 47);">Secondly, Burst provides a proprietary/extended SQL-like language pipeline transforming human friendly high level questions into tight code-generated, hardware sympathetic distributed/parallel query processing plans. Along with the basics of counting, filtering, and grouping/dimensioning, it also provides a toolkit of specialized causal/temporal pattern matching semantics. Burst allows you to ask almost unlimited complexity behavioral questions about extremely large numbers of complex entities in interactive time.</span><br></p>
                        <p class="p-why-burst"><span style="color: rgb(36, 41, 47);">Finally all of this sits on top of a bespoke data model based on a specialized schema-driven binary-data entity encoding approach. Each entity in a behavioral dataset is a carefully designed object-tree. The Burst processing model depends on extremely fast efficient scans of these entity models where each scan is a depth-first-search of the entity tree including the time ordered event histories that capture the semantics of its behavior. These scans must be hyper efficient in both time and space and always parallelize effectively across many threads. The data model is designed to be stored (cached) efficiently on disk and page rapidly in and out of memory on linux file systems. Both SSD and striped magnetic drive storage is supported. The data is highly compressible and network friendly. Burst includes a refined parallel network data transfer protocol for very fast imports of data views from highly parallel distributed data storage systems such as Hadoop/HBase.</span><br></p>
                        <p class="p-why-burst"><span style="color: rgb(36, 41, 47);">Common Burst deployments would contain hundreds of worker nodes each with dozens of cores all running near peak speed and efficiency. All of these components have gone through multiple generations of ruthless elimination of excess CPU cycles and memory churn. It is simply impractical to repurpose a relational system or key-value/map-reduce system to match this sort of uncompromising singular focus. If you have the normal enormous amounts of behavioral data and you want to ask interesting behavioral questions with answers in interactive time then a system like Burst is likely to be your best if not only option.</span><br></p>
