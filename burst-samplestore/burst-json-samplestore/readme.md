# JSON Samplestore

The JSON Samplestore package includes two utility-style sample stores to make it easy to take Burst for a test drive.

## JSON Samplestore

The JSON Samplestore will load a local json file (optionally gzipped) and press it into a dataset.

## Synthetic Samplestore

The Syntetic Samplestore will use a generator to materialize a dataset on demand.
